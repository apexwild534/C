Basic Structure Usage:
1. Write a C program that defines a structure representing a point in 2D space and calculates the distance between two points.
2. Create a program that defines a structure representing a student with fields for name, roll number, and marks, and calculates the average marks for a group of students.
3. Implement a program that defines a structure representing a book with fields for title, author, and price, and displays the details of a book.

Structure Arrays:
1. Develop a C program that uses an array of structures to store information about employees (name, employee ID, and salary) and finds the employee with the highest salary.
2. Create a program that defines a structure to represent a date (day, month, year) and sorts an array of dates in chronological order.

Nested Structures:
1. Write a program that defines a structure representing a person with fields for name, address (another structure), and age, and displays the details of a person.
2. Implement a C program that defines a structure representing a department with fields for department name and employees (an array of structures), and calculates the average salary for the department.

File Handling with Structures:
1. Develop a program that reads a list of student records from a file into an array of structures and then writes the records back to another file.
2. Create a program that reads a list of books from a file, stores them in an array of structures, and displays the books sorted by price.

Advanced:
1. Write a C program that implements a simple inventory management system using structures. The program should allow users to add, update, delete, and search for products in the inventory.
