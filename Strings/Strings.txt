7. Implement a function that counts the occurrences of a substring within a larger string.
8. Write a program that converts a string to its lowercase equivalent.
9. Develop a program that checks if two strings are anagrams (contain the same characters in a different order).
10. Create a program that tokenizes a sentence into words and stores them in an array of strings.
